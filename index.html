		<p>ALL COMMANDS I TYPE NEED < > AROUND THEM IM REPLASING THEM WITH ~ !</p>
		<p> Websites are simple to make, you just got to try. So lets start with the basics. If you use html (recommended) you will need to start with ~DOCTYPEhtml~ . Then you will need to add ~html~, now you can chose your title. Example ~title Hello ~/title~ then if you want a font go to Google fonts and just search until you find one. To put words in your page use ~p~ Examlple ~/p~. To make a heading do ~h1~ Example ~/h1~  Now you may be thinking this is boring with no color. Well, time to make a CSS file!</p>

		<h2> CSS file!</h2>
		<p>You will need to make a new fill name it anything with .css at the end, Example.css . Then, you can edit things like background color or font color image size. So to start with body { } you may want to put things like background-color:tomato or font-size: or color: or even font-family: . You may want to aline your headings to the center so you would do h1 { } and put things like Text-align: center or color: .
